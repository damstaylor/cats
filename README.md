## About

The challenge consists in building a web app that displays a grid of pictures of cats + breed name, origin and a link to the wiki page with the data coming from https://docs.thecatapi.com.
The challenge comes with the following constraints:
* Built with Nuxt.js and be server side rendered
* The app must be responsive
* The cats list will be paginated
* We will test the app with multiple network speeds so it needs to prioritise visible content and display placeholders
* The project must have a comprehensive README with how to launch the server on my machine + requirements
* Do not use any existing component libraries (bootstrap, vuetify, element ect...)


## How to launch the app

* Download the source code and unzip it.

* Open a terminal app and enter the following commands:

```bash
# Go to the unzipped directory (replace content below by accurate path)
$ cd Path/Of/The/Folder/cats-master

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

* Open your favorite browser and go to the following link: `http://localhost:3000/`
